# Solar Radiation Analysis
This repository contains the files needed to run the data analysis.

# Context
We have 3 datasets containing solar radiation data for 3 different countries: Benin, Togo and Sierra Leone. As the datasets are large, we have not uploaded them to the repository. The main aim of this analysis at present is to understand temperature fluctuations within these countries.
